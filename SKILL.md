- Preventing moral failure and scandal
- Creating policies for financial or relational conduct
- Onboarding new leaders with clear expectations

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| role | Yes | The leadership position or context being assessed |
| vulnerabilities | No | Known areas of risk or past failures |
| scope | No | Individual, team, or organizational level |
| context | No | Ministry, business, nonprofit, etc. |

## Historical Background

In 1948, Billy Graham and his core team (Cliff Barrows, George Beverly Shea, and Grady Wilson) met in Modesto, California during an evangelistic campaign. They had observed how other evangelists and ministry leaders had fallen into scandal, destroying their credibility and the reputation of their message.

Together, they made four resolutions - not rules to impose on others, but commitments to govern their own lives. These became known as the "Modesto Manifesto."

The result: Billy Graham maintained his integrity through 60 years of public ministry, counseled 12 U.S. presidents, and finished his race without scandal. His ministry remains credible decades later.

## The Four Pillars

### Pillar 1: Financial Integrity

**The Problem They Observed:**
Many evangelists relied on emotional love offerings, with little accountability for how funds were used. The temptation to exaggerate needs or misappropriate funds destroyed ministries.

**Their Resolution:**
- Fixed salary rather than percentage of offerings
- No personal control over offerings
- Full financial transparency and accountability
- External audits and oversight
- Modest living, not personal enrichment from ministry

**Application Questions:**
- How is money handled in your organization/role?
- Who has oversight of financial decisions?
- Are you living modestly relative to those you serve?
- Could you survive public scrutiny of your finances?
- Is there separation between personal and organizational funds?

**Safeguards to Implement:**
- External financial audits
- Multiple signatories on major expenditures
- Transparent reporting to board/stakeholders
- Published financial statements
- Clear policies on compensation and expense reimbursement
- No personal enrichment from position

---

### Pillar 2: Sexual Purity (The "Billy Graham Rule")

**The Problem They Observed:**
Sexual scandal had destroyed countless leaders. Beyond actual moral failure, even the appearance of impropriety could undermine credibility.

**Their Resolution:**
- Never be alone with a woman other than one's wife
- Maintain appropriate physical and relational boundaries
- Avoid situations that could lead to temptation or accusation
- Protect both against moral failure AND false accusations

**Application Questions:**
- What situations put you at risk for temptation?
- What situations could create false impressions?
- How do you ensure accountability in relationships?
- Are there patterns that need to change?

**Safeguards to Implement:**
- Never meet alone with someone of the opposite sex behind closed doors
- Keep meeting spaces visible (glass walls, open doors)
- Travel with appropriate accountability partners
- Limit one-on-one communication appropriately
- Have clear policies known to staff and stakeholders
- Address concerning patterns early, before they become crises

**Note:** This principle should be adapted wisely to context. The goal is protecting integrity and preventing harm, not creating rigid rules that become legalistic or prevent appropriate ministry. Modern applications may look different than 1948 implementations.

---

### Pillar 3: Honest Reporting

**The Problem They Observed:**
Evangelists often exaggerated attendance numbers, conversion statistics, and ministry impact. This built short-term enthusiasm but destroyed long-term credibility.

**Their Resolution:**
- Never exaggerate numbers or results
- Report accurately, even when the truth is less impressive
- Build credibility through honesty, not hype
- Let God do the work; don't manufacture it

**Application Questions:**
- Are your claims verifiable?
- Do you inflate success stories or statistics?
- Would your reports survive fact-checking?
- Are you transparent about failures and challenges?

**Safeguards to Implement:**
- Independent verification of key statistics
- Consistent reporting methodology
- Willingness to admit failures and setbacks
- No "bait and switch" in communications
- Accurate representation in fundraising appeals
- Culture that rewards honesty over hype

---

### Pillar 4: Cooperative Relationships (Working with Local Churches/Organizations)

**The Problem They Observed:**
Some evangelists operated as independent operators, sometimes competing with or undermining local churches. This created resentment and disconnected converts from ongoing discipleship.

**Their Resolution:**
- Work in partnership with local congregations
- Direct converts to local churches for follow-up
- Support rather than compete with existing work
- Leave things better than they found them

**Application Questions:**
- Do you build up or compete with peer organizations?
- Do you connect people to ongoing community or just your platform?
- Are you supporting the broader ecosystem or just your own empire?
- Would local leaders speak well of your cooperation?

**Safeguards to Implement:**
- Formal partnerships with local organizations
- Follow-up systems that connect people locally
- Collaborative rather than competitive stance
- Credit-sharing and mutual support
- Long-term relationship building, not transactional engagement
- Exit strategies that strengthen what remains

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a solo pastor of a growing church. We just crossed 500 members and I'm getting speaking invitations. What integrity safeguards should I put in place now, before things go wrong?"

**Output:**

## Modesto Manifesto Integrity Audit

### Role/Context Assessed

You are a solo pastor of a 500-member church with growing visibility. This is a critical moment - success creates opportunity, but opportunity creates vulnerability. The time to build safeguards is now, before pressure increases and patterns solidify.

### Financial Integrity

**Current State:** As the church grows, financial complexity increases. Speaking honoraria add a new income stream with potential conflicts.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Unclear boundaries between church compensation and outside income
- Potential for expense account abuse as travel increases
- Lack of external oversight as "founding pastor"
- Growing budget with possible informal controls

**Recommended Safeguards:**
- Engage an external CPA for annual audit
- Establish a finance committee with non-staff members
- Create clear written policy on speaking honoraria (do they go to church or to you personally?)
- Require dual signatures on all expenditures over $1,000
- Publish annual financial report to congregation
- Set your salary through board process, not self-determination
- Maintain modest lifestyle visible to congregation

### Sexual/Relational Purity

**Current State:** Solo pastor means less built-in accountability. Growing visibility increases attention and opportunity for inappropriate connection.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Counseling sessions with members of opposite sex
- Late nights at church alone
- Social media access and private messaging
- Travel to speaking engagements without accountability
- Power dynamics with staff and congregants

**Recommended Safeguards:**
- Never counsel women alone behind closed doors; use glass-walled offices or have staff nearby
- Limit after-hours one-on-one meetings; have another person in the building
- Travel with spouse or accountability partner when possible
- Give spouse access to all email and social media accounts
- Establish clear policy on physical boundaries (hugs, touch)
- Refer extended counseling to professional counselors
- Create reporting mechanism for concerns that bypasses you

### Honest Reporting

**Current State:** Growing church creates pressure to keep demonstrating growth. Speaking invitations reward impressive statistics.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- Temptation to inflate attendance or conversion numbers
- "Success theater" in reports to congregation
- Selective storytelling that hides challenges
- Pressure to exaggerate in promotional materials for speaking

**Recommended Safeguards:**
- Establish consistent, verifiable counting methodology
- Report honestly about challenges, not just wins
- Have elders verify major claims before publication
- Avoid comparison-based competition with other churches
- When things aren't going well, say so
- Maintain same standards for speaking promotional materials

### Cooperative Relationships

**Current State:** Growing church can become insular; speaking ministry can become disconnected from local body.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- "Empire building" that competes rather than cooperates
- Speaking ministry taking time and energy from primary calling
- Failure to connect new believers to small groups and discipleship
- Transactional rather than relational engagement with other pastors

**Recommended Safeguards:**
- Build genuine friendships with other local pastors
- Limit speaking engagements to sustainable rhythm
- When speaking elsewhere, partner with local churches for follow-up
- Create robust assimilation process for new church members
- Invest in other leaders rather than centralizing around yourself
- Ask: "Am I building the Kingdom or my platform?"

### Priority Actions

1. **Establish elder/board oversight of finances and compensation** - This protects you and the church, and should happen immediately
2. **Create counseling and meeting policies** - Document and communicate before any situation arises
3. **Clarify speaking engagement boundaries** - Decide now how many, under what terms, and where the money goes

### Accountability Structure

Consider:
- Monthly meeting with 2-3 peer pastors who can ask hard questions
- Quarterly review with church board including all four areas
- Spouse as daily accountability partner
- Professional coach or mentor outside your church context

The time to build the guardrails is when the road is clear, not when you're already skidding toward the edge. You're wise to ask now. Implement these safeguards, and you'll be able to look back decades from now with your integrity intact.
